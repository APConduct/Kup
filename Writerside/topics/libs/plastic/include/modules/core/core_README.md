# PLASTIC CORE MODULES :cookie:
## Modules in the core directory should be as generic as possible and try to not depend on types in other modules, and if not, they should mingle in an inner directory, but using using interfaces is more understandable. :wood:
## There are different types of core modules: types, utilities, dependency wrapping, interfaces, and other modules that are not specific to a particular module. :cookie:
